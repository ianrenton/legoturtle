legoturtle
==========

Arduino programs for controlling a Lego Mindstorms robot. See http://ianrenton.com/legoturtle for videos, schematics and build photos!

legoturtle-flippers
-------------------

Simple navigation program based on two drive motors and two "flippers" to sense collisions.

legoturtle-logo
---------------

Control program with a Logo interpreter, so that the robot can be programmed with simple Logo commands that are written at compile time. Kind of redundant really as Logo is no easier than writing the Arduino code itself, but this is a stepping stone to the version that will receive the Logo program over UART.
